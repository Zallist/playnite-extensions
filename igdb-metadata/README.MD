# IGDB Metadata Extended extension

The built-in playnite extension for IGDB relies on a custom backend to work around the need for users to get their own developer login for IGDB, which is great,
but also a pain if you want custom data or to modify the functionality. That backend also relies on a data dump from IGDB themselves.

This extension is built like other metadata extensions - No backend needed, it just accesses IGDB through the API.
