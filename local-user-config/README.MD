# Local User Config

Attempts to make Playnite usable by multiple users. The only real use-case for this is if you have Playnite on your network drive, but have some means that copies it
to your local drive on startup. Ergo, you keep getting any changes you make to games.db or app settings clobbered. This stores a backup of any user-relevant settings that
are not game-related metadata. It's not perfect.
