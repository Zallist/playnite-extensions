# Kid Mode

Locks down Playnite pretty hard if the --kidmode argument is passed to the .exe, or kidmode is enabled via the button at the top:

* Closes any window that opens that might allow changing game details or playnite settings
* Forces a filter which only shows games tagged for Kidmode
* Stores the kid-mode enabled games in a secondary file to ensure they aren't lost and are difficult to mess with
